    question: 'Is my health data secure and private?',

  {
    question: 'Does this replace seeing a doctor?',
    answer: 'No, our platform is designed to complement medical care, not replace it. We provide risk assessment and screening tools to help you make informed decisions about when to seek professional medical attention. Always consult healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment.',

    question: 'How accurate is the AI risk assessment?',
    answer: 'Our AI model has been trained on millions of clinical data points and achieves 94% accuracy in risk stratification. However, all AI assessments are reviewed by licensed medical professionals through our human-in-the-loop verification process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I\'m classified as high risk?',
    answer: 'If our assessment indicates elevated risk, you\'ll receive immediate guidance and we\'ll help connect you with qualified cardiologists in your area. We also provide personalized lifestyle recommendations and ongoing monitoring support.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does the assessment cost?',
    answer: 'Basic risk assessment is free and includes your cardiovascular score with general recommendations. Our premium service ($29/month) includes detailed analysis, ongoing monitoring, and priority access to cardiologist referrals.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upload existing medical reports?',
    answer: 'Yes! You can upload lab results, ECGs, imaging reports, and other medical documents. Our AI can analyze these alongside your conversational assessment to provide a more comprehensive risk evaluation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this available internationally?',
    answer: 'Currently available in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. We\'re expanding to other countries throughout 2025. Cardiologist referral networks vary by location, but risk assessment is available globally.',
